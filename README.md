# Pac-Man Game with A* Pathfinding 🎮

This is a Python implementation of the classic Pac-Man game, featuring A* and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms for ghost movement. The game is built using the Pygame library and demonstrates basic game development concepts and graph travseral/pathfinding techniques.

This project was created as a fun way to compare Dijkstra's Algorithm with the A* Algorithm for UC Berkeley's Extension "Data Structures and Algorithms" COMPSCI X404.1 course.

## Features ✨

- 🕹️ Classic Pac-Man gameplay
- 🤖 A* and Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithms for ghost movement
- 🔄 Ability to switch between A* and Dijkstra's algorithms during gameplay
- 🗺️ Customizable maze layout
- 🏆 Score tracking
- 🚀 Game over screen with restart option

## Requirements 🛠️

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🎮 Pygame library

## Installation 💻

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library by running:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Download the `pacman_game.py` file to your local machine.

## How to Play 🎮

1. Run the game by executing the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python pacman_game.py
   ```
2. Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man:
   - ⬆️ Up Arrow: Move Up
   - ⬇️ Down Arrow: Move Down
   - ⬅️ Left Arrow: Move Left
   - ➡️ Right Arrow: Move Right
3. Eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts.
4. Press 'A' to switch to A* pathfinding algorithm.
5. Press 'D' to switch to Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm.

## Game Controls 🎮

- ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ Arrow Keys: Move Pac-Man
- 🅰️ 'A' Key: Switch to A* pathfinding algorithm
- 🅳 'D' Key: Switch to Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm
- 🔄 'R' Key: Restart the game (on game over screen)
- ❌ 'Q' Key: Quit the game (on game over screen)

## Customization 🛠️

You can customize the game by modifying the following variables in the `pacman_game.py` file:

- `MAZE`: Change the layout of the maze
- `CELL_SIZE`: Adjust the size of each cell in the maze
- `PACMAN_START`: Set Pac-Man's starting position
- `GHOST_STARTS`: Set the starting positions of the ghosts

## Code Structure 📂

- `PacmanGame` class: Main game logic
- `draw_grid`: Renders the maze
- `draw_entities`: Renders Pac-Man and ghosts
- `move_pacman`: Handles Pac-Man movement
- `move_ghosts`: Manages ghost movement using pathfinding
- `a_star` and `dijkstra`: Implement pathfinding algorithms
- `game_over_screen`: Displays the game over screen
- `run`: Main game loop
